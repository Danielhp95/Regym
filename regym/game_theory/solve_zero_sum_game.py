    r'''
    Solving the :param matrix: game for the row player corresponds to finding
    a mixed strategy (a probability distribution over the actions [rows])
    such that the value obtained by playing such mixed strategy is maximized

    This problem can be specified as a linear program with the following variables:
        - |A_{row_player}| variables corresponding to the support for each action (s).
          where A_{row_player} is the action space for the row player.
        - 1 variable corresponding to the minimax value (V)

    Formulation:

        maximize V
        such that:
              (1)  \sum_{a \in A_{row_player} U_{row} (a, a_j) * s_a >= V   \forall a_j \in A_{column_player}
              (2)  s_a >= 0  \forall a \in A_{row_player} (Prababilities must be positive)
              (3)  \sum_{a \in A_{row_player} s_a = 1 (Probabilities sum to one)
