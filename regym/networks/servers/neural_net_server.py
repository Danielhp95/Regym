class NeuralNetServerHandler:
    r'''
    A NeuralNetServerHandler is a wrapper around a Process which holds a
    neural network that processes requests by:
        - Gathering input observations from incoming connections:
        - Pre-processes input observations and puts them into a single batch
        - Batch is forward-passed through neural network
        - Each datapoint in output batch is sent back through the connection
          that requested it.

    This approach centralizes the use of a neural network, instead of making
    each process use it's own neural net. This is useful for algorithms like
    Expert Iteration, where multiple MCTS processes require to processes
    forward passes from the same neural network (to compute action priors
    during the expansion phase).

    NOTE: The underlying server Process is started upon initialization, but has to
    be closed either manually or by exiting the python interpreter that
    generated the NeuralNetServerHandler (python finishing its run).

    Usage:
    1 - Creation
    A neural net needs to be specified, alongside the number
    of connections exposed by the server, connections are multiprocessing.Pipe
    objects.
    >>> net: nn.Module  # Existing torch based neural network
    >>> server_handler = NeuralNetServer(num_connections=2, net=net)
    >>> server_handler.client_connections  # type: list, lenght: 2

    2 - Sending requests
    Sending a request involves sending a 2-element tuple
    (observations, legal_actions), legal_actions CAN be `None`.
    Send this tuple through a connection using the aforementioned
    multiprocessing.Pipe interface.
    >>> legal_actions: List[int]   # Available actions at a given env state
    >>> observation: torch.Tensor  # Environment state / observation
    >>> server_handler.client_connections[0].send((observation, legal_actions)

    3 - Receiving requests
    The server will receive the request and process it, depositing the result
    in the same connection (Pipe) that requested it.
    >>> processed_request = server_handler.client_connections[0].recv()

    4 - Close server
    >>> server_handler.close_server()
